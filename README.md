# DeepConvNetworksR

Motivation

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are biologically-inspired variants of MLPs. From Hubel and Wiesel’s early work on the cat’s visual cortex [Hubel68], we know the visual cortex contains a complex arrangement of cells. These cells are sensitive to small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive field. The sub-regions are tiled to cover the entire visual field. These cells act as local filters over the input space and are well-suited to exploit the strong spatially local correlation present in natural images.

R scripts for deep CNN.

We will start with our first CNN for vessel detection.

To achieve this approach we need a novel algorithm for this purpose.

First task:

DCNN vessel classification task.
